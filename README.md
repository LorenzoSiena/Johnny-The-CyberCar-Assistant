# A CYBERCAR STUDY FROM THE EDGE TO THE CLOUD

## Abstract
The thesis explores and verifies the state of the art for IoT, experimenting with and prototyping a Cybercar with a voice assistant on the vehicle. 
It uses edge computing for keyword spotting and cloud computing for hosting an open-source, multilingual, and customizable AI chatbot on a consumer GPU (GTX 1080 Ti). 
This system can interact with the user vocally and, when connected to the car's internal bus, can perceive the car's status.

A proof of concept, a prototype and a case study are presented, in addition to all
the necessary hardware and software documentation. 
The study shows that it is possible with current technologies to make a common car smart, up to a
level and depth that depends on the access to the internal dynamics of the car,
accessible from the OBD-II debug port and using the protocols available on the bus.
